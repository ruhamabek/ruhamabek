🚀 Hi, I’m Ruhama Bekele (@ruhamabek)

👀 Passionate about full-stack development — building scalable apps that connect strong backends with seamless user experiences.

🌱 Currently exploring advanced frontend design and mobile development to complement my backend expertise.

💻 Tech stack I enjoy working with:

⚡ Next.js for modern full-stack web apps

📱 React Native for cross-platform mobile development

🛠 Prisma + PostgreSQL for type-safe, reliable databases

🌐 MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for rapid prototyping and robust systems

💡 Experience so far:

1.5 years working with MongoDB, Node.js, React.js, TypeScript

1 year building with Prisma + PostgreSQL

Hands-on with both frontend and backend services

🤝 Looking to collaborate on:

Full-stack projects (web + mobile)

Backend systems and APIs

Database-driven applications
