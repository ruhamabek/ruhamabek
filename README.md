👋 Hi, I’m Ruhama Bekele, also known as @ruhamabek on GitHub.
👀 I’m interested in full stack web development, especially working with mongoDB and SQL and creating robust, scalable systems.
🌱 I’m currently diving into frontend development to expand my skill set beyond backend and database work.
💻 My experience: 1
year with MongoDB, Node.js, React.js, TypeScript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontend projects and backend services.
